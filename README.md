# 👾 infiniTani | Game Developer

Welcome to my corner of the infinite digital universe! 🌌 I'm Tani, a game developer with a passion for creating unique experiences. My work is driven by creativity, endless curiosity, and a desire to push the boundaries of interactive storytelling.

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **Rise&Shine**: My upcoming mobile game, a puzzle platformer initially made for the Learn You A Game Jam 2024
- **TimeRewind2D**: A godot plugin that implements time-warping abilities inspired by games like *Braid*. This project was initially developed for the *Mechanically Challenged* challenge.
- **Twitch Stream Overlay**: My custom twitch overlay built with godot that turns my viewers into walking characters on the stream and much more.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

- **Game Development**: Always honing my skills in Godot, from implementing intricate mechanics to designing immersive worlds.
- **Art, Music, Models**: And all the various skills I need for gamedev!

## 🧠 Fun Facts

- Deadpan humor is my go-to, so expect a few dry jokes here and there.
- I have the attention span of a fruit-fly, so much so that I'm called Dementia Gamedev 'round these parts 😭
